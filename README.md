[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using machine learning techniques. It uses a medical dataset containing various health parameters to classify whether a patient has CKD or not. The model helps in early detection of CKD, which can assist healthcare professionals in providing timely intervention.

The project demonstrates data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment of the final predictive model.
